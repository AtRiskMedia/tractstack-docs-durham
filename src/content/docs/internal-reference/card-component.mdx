By leveraging the card component, you can elegently package your content into concise, and easily digestible tid-bits that allow you to prioritize 
the most useful information. This makes it incredibly readable, and easiy accessible for everybody that is looking to dive into TractStack.

To implement this, follow these steps: 

<Code code={cardComponent_Code} lang="mdx"/>

The code present in the block showcases how I implemented the cards above. When implementing your card components, you are able to use 
more Astro Starlight components to further control the look of your cards. Within the brackets of the \<Card\>, you are able to use the "icon="""
attribute, as well as the "title=""" to add a little icon and title into your card like so:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Concise" icon="github">
    Look at how concise this is.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Imagine" icon="star">
    Imagine reading documentation with info laid out like this.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

<Code code={cardComponent_CodeIcon} lang="mdx"/>

Cards provide a clean and organized way to break down complex content into manageable tidbits. We've all been there - Stuck in the ocean of text looking for
one piece of information, struggling to find it. This makes cards one of the most incredible assets that you can find and utilize while working with Astro Starlight.

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

export const tabComponent_Code = `import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Click Here" >
    This is where
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Click Here">
    the tab component comes into play.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>`;

export const tabComponent_CodeIcon = `import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="School!" icon="pencil">
    In the label of this tab, we have a pencil icon.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Detective!" icon="manifier">
    In the label of this tab, we have a magnifying glass.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Warning!" icon="warning">
    In the label of this tab, we have a warning icon.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="GitHub!" icon="github">
    In the label of this tab, we have the GitHub logo.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>`;

You can almost always expect the pages of your documentation to be filled to the brim with content.
A lot of the time, you'll get lost in your writing but then take a step back and realize that you've written
a lot more than you initially intended, and now your users have to scrounge through 100 mouse scrolls worth of content.

With this being a major concern during the documentation development process, Astro Starlight has taken the liberty of
incorporating a component that'll change the way you stash your content.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Click Here" >
    #### This is where
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Click Here">
    #### the tab component comes into play.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

By utilizing the tab component featured above, you have the ability to condense the most important, and the most
relevant content on your pages into an easily readable, and easily accessible manner.

The way in which you would implement this is as follows: 

<Code code={tabComponent_Code} lang="mdx"/>

The code present in the block showcases how I implemented the tab component above. Within the code block, you are able to use 
more Astro Starlight components to further control the look of your tabs. Within the brackets of the \<TabItem\>, you are able to use the "icon="""
attribute to add a little icon in your tab like so:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="School!" icon="pencil">
    #### In the label of this tab, we have a pencil icon.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Detective!" icon="manifier">
    #### In the label of this tab, we have a magnifying glass.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Warning!" icon="warning">
    #### In the label of this tab, we have a warning icon.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="GitHub!" icon="github">
    #### In the label of this tab, we have the GitHub logo.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

And as stated above, the way in which you would implement this is by using the "icon=""" attribute, so the code would look as follows:

<Code code={tabComponent_CodeIcon} lang="mdx"/>

Tabs provide an incredibly simple and intuitive way to condense the content on your page into an easily readable and accessible format.
Documentation gets wordy, and sometimes we need a way to simplify things, as well as condense things so our users aren't sifting through mounds
of information that may not be relevant to them. Having the ability to jump to the specific area you need without having to utilize key-binds like "CTRL + F" certainly guarantees 
the best user experience.

import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

export const exampleCode = `import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

export const exampleCode = \`console.log('This could come from a file or CMS!')\`;
export const fileName = 'example.js';
export const highlights = ['file', 'CMS'];

<Code code={exampleCode} lang="js" title={fileName} mark={highlights} />`;

export const exampleCode_output = `console.log('This could come from a file or CMS!');`;
export const fileName = 'example.js';
export const highlights = ['file', 'CMS'];

export const tractStackBuildCode_block = `\import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
export const tractStackBuildCode_output = \`sudo ./build.sh front birch\`;\``;

export const tractStackBuildCode_output = `sudo ./build.sh front birch`;


As a part of any well-made documentation site, drawing attention to key content for the benefit of site visitors is imperative.
Astro Starlight provides an extensive library of components and integrations that are designed for this purpose. Amongst the extensive library stands 
the ability to highlight code content through the use of code blocks. These code blocks serve as powerful tools, enabling you to showcase snippets of code, scripts,
or configurations in a visually distinct and easily digestible manner. By leveraging this integration, you can ensure that crucial information such as the TractStack installation process
stands outerHeight, allowing for clearer communication, and enhancing the overall user experience.


### How to implement

The basic syntax for getting a code block goes as follows.

<Code code={exampleCode} lang="mdx"/>

The output of the code above would be:
<Code code={exampleCode_output} lang="js" title={fileName} mark={highlights} />

By applying this logic to showcase TractStack build scripts, we are able to present the scripts in a way that looks like this

<Code code={tractStackBuildCode_block} lang="mdx"/>

By building the presented codeblock as we did above, it would output the following codeblock: 

<Code code={tractStackBuildCode_output} lang="bash"/>

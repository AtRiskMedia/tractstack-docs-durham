Among the many useful features provided by Astro Starlight, is the ability to place content into tabs. These 
tabs can be used to break up information so less space will be taken up while still providing needed information. One example for a tab to be 
useful is to show multiple ways to create a new project.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="npm">
        ```bash title=""
        npm create astro@latest
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="pnpm">
        ```bash title=""
        pnpm create astro@latest
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Yarn">
        ```bash title=""
        yarn create astro
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Tabs make it very easy to display information in a clear and concise way for the user in minimal space
